# Evolutionary Viability Theory
Repository for the experiments on EAs applied to viability theory

## Ideas
1. Add the limits to the state variables as values to seed the initial population of gplearn.

## TODO
Maybe, since gplearn's library is not very big, I could just use a local version, to avoid issues.
